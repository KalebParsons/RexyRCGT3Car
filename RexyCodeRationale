Started by checking the imports the we would need for Python to be able to operate our Raspberry Pi properly.

evdev allows us to communicate with an xbox controller. This allows us to decode events from the xbxo controller and decode them into python for processing.
using evdev, we can also create virtual devices to test our code without the need for a physical device being used. this is an added bonus.

Our car has 2 DC motors. one to power the steering linkage and the other to power the rear wheels. Our code will need to include the use of 2 DC motors for
2 different purposes. We will need functions for forwards and backwards. we will name these functions 'forward' and 'backward' respectivley. our forwards and backwards 
functsions will take inputs from the left and right triggers on the controller. Ontop of this, we will also need two functions labeled 'left' and 'right' using the same 
premise as our forward and backward functions. However, these will take different inputs from the controller joysticks rather than the left and right triggers.

Using BCM numbering allows us to follow the Raspberry pis actual pin numbers when it comes time to connecting our system.
PMW allows us to quickly switch the motor on an off at the desired frequency. we have preset this value to 100. however, we may need to increase this
with further testing. the raspberry bi does not allow for variable power. its is simple binary on or off. using the PWM function allows us to 
modulate the power using 

Further annotations will be provided within the code itself. Any larger ideas that require further explnantion will be documented within this read me file. This is 
to esnure that there is a common understanding for the reasoning behind our choices.

Updates to our code can be found in this repository. edits and change will be documented and can be commited by both Jeremy and I.
